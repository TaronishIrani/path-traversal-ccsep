# path-traversal-ccsep
Just a place to store our stuff

- Download the pathtraversalDemo.zip for the final copy
- After extracting, there should be two folders inside called attacker and victim.
- To run the demo you must run "docker compose up" in both the attacker and victim folders.
- I suggest having two seperate terminals open inside each folder.
- To access the test website, use your host machine IP address followed by ":8000/index.php"
- The final link should look like "http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8000/index.php"
- From here you can test the demo, there is also a button to switch to the patched version for testing
